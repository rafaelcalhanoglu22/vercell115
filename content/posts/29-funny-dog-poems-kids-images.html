                I write kids poetry all the time, just for fun. Classic poems for kids to memorize that they will actually love. The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse, the howling dog by the door of the house, the bat that lies in these are funny poems for kids, with a touch of animal cuteness.

    <h3>My dog lives on the sofa.</h3>
    <p>And he aways brings the stick back; Kids have great brain power and poems they learn now will stay with them forever. Walking the dog seems like fun to me by roger stevens dad said, the dog wants a walk. Whenever there&#039;s a tennis match he nearly comes unglued.</p>
